### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here::here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling & summary statistics using functions in the 'dplyr' package. 

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal status, do some wrangling, and make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% #count replaces group_by and summarize_n and puts it into a table
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>%
  # relocate(tree_count) # can't get relocate to work
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)

```
